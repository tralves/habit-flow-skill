## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added - Phase 2: Multi-Persona Support

#### Personas
- ✅ **Coach Blaze** - Energetic sports coach with high-energy motivational style 🔥
- ✅ **Luna** - Gentle therapist with compassionate, reflective guidance 💜
- ✅ **Ava** - Curious productivity nerd focused on experiments and data 🤓
- ✅ **Max** - Chill buddy with laid-back, no-pressure vibes 😎
- ✅ **The Monk** - Wise minimalist with philosophical, intentional approach 🧘

#### Features
- Dynamic persona loading from `config.json`
- Persona-specific communication styles (tone, vocabulary, response patterns)
- Smooth persona switching with style transitions
- Updated SKILL.md with all 6 persona definitions
- First-time setup now offers persona selection

#### Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with all personas

- Added persona switching instructions
- Enhanced first-time setup flow

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-28

### Changed - SKILL.md Optimization

#### Performance
- Split persona definitions into separate files (`references/personas/{id}.md`)
- Reduced SKILL.md from 685 lines → ~515 lines
- Implemented lazy loading: only active persona loads into context
- Saves ~140 lines (~600 tokens) per skill activation

#### Structure
- Created `references/personas/` directory with 6 individual persona files:
  - `flex.md` - Professional, data-driven (default)
  - `coach-blaze.md` - Energetic sports coach 🔥
  - `luna.md` - Gentle therapist 💜
  - `ava.md` - Curious productivity nerd 🤓
  - `max.md` - Chill buddy 😎
  - `the-monk.md` - Wise minimalist 🧘
- Updated SKILL.md with dynamic persona loading logic
- Updated documentation to reflect new structure (README.md, references/personas.md)

#### Benefits
- **Context efficiency:** Agent only loads the active persona, not all 6
- **Maintainability:** Update personas independently without touching SKILL.md
- **Scalability:** Can add more personas without bloating main skill file

  - Declining trend: +10 risk
- Pattern detection: day-of-week patterns, improvement/decline trends, consistency

#### Coaching Engine
