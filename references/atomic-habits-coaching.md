# Atomic Habits Coaching Techniques

Use these evidence-based techniques from atomic habits and behavioral science to help users build lasting habits:

## 1. MINIMUM QUOTAS (MICRO-HABITS)

When someone struggles, suggest making the habit incredibly small. "Just meditate for 30 seconds" is better than skipping entirely. The goal is consistency over intensity.

## 2. HABIT STACKING

Link new habits to existing routines. "After I pour my morning coffee, I will..." This leverages existing neural pathways and makes the new habit easier to remember and execute.

## 3. REDUCE FRICTION

Help identify and remove obstacles that make the habit harder to do. If they want to exercise, suggest laying out workout clothes the night before, or finding a gym closer to home.

## 4. OPTIMIZE TIMING

Find when the habit fits naturally into their schedule. Are they a morning person? Evening person? Right after work? Match habits to natural energy levels and existing routines.

## 5. TWO-MINUTE RULE

Any habit can start with just 2 minutes. "Read one page," "Do two push-ups," "Write one sentence." Once started, momentum often carries them further.

## 6. IMMEDIATE REWARDS

Add instant gratification to make the habit more satisfying. Check off a list, use a habit tracker, play favorite music during the activity, or pair the habit with something enjoyable.

## 7. TEMPTATION BUNDLING

Combine habits with pleasures. "I only listen to my favorite podcast while walking" or "I only watch Netflix while on the exercise bike."

## 8. IDENTIFY BREAKDOWN POINTS

When do they typically fail? Weekends? Stressful days? Travel days? Plan specific strategies and backup plans for these high-risk situations.

## 9. REFRAME AND REFLECT

Connect habits to deeper values and identity. Help them see themselves as "someone who..." rather than "someone trying to..." This shifts from external motivation to internal identity.

## Coaching Guidelines by Streak Level

### When User Has Low Streak (<3 days)
- Validate their struggle
- Don't shame or guilt
- Suggest minimum quotas
- Identify friction points
- Offer habit stacking

**Example:**
> "Your meditation streak reset, but that's part of the journey. Let's make it easier: try just 30 seconds after your morning coffee. Remove the pressure of perfection."

### When User Has Good Streak (7-14 days)
- Celebrate the milestone
- Reinforce the pattern
- Prepare for breakdown points
- Connect to identity

**Example:**
> "🔥 10-day streak! You're building real momentum. What's helping you stay consistent? Let's plan ahead for any upcoming challenges."

### When User Has Strong Streak (15+ days)
- Major celebration
- Identity reinforcement
- Explore expansion opportunities
- Maintain sustainability

**Example:**
> "🔥 20 days straight! You're not just meditating—you're a meditator now. That's a powerful identity shift. How does this habit feel at this point?"

### When User Misses a Day
- Forgiveness built-in (1-day grace)
- Quick recovery encouragement
- Learn from the breakdown

**Example:**
> "You have 1 forgiveness day remaining this streak. No worries—life happens. What made yesterday challenging? Let's prevent that next time."
